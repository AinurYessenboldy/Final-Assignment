# Final-Assignment

This is a coding repository with analysis of dataset about used car models in Chicago and LA cities in 2018. Dataset was obtained from Gabors open data platform, it is named "used-cars" and used in csv format for this project. Analysis in performed on Python 3 Jupyter notebook and Stata. Project includes initial data cleansing on missing values, unnecessary symbols, then data manipulation and transformation on some interesting observations and also data vizualisation on some categorical data. Although nature of analysis for both Python and Stata is about exploring and studying dataset, some operations and vizualisations are different. Analysis on both environments was conducted thoroughly and successfully. In the end, I have added all the files to the git repository and pushed to the remote repository on the github.
